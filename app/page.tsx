                I&apos;m Kilian Peyron, a web development enthusiast since I was
                15. Currently, I&apos;m studying Computer Science at IUT Lyon1.
                Iâ€™m dedicated to improving my skills through my studies and
                personal projects. My goal is to become a skilled web developer
                who can create engaging and functional websites.

                I have experience in web development, especially with
                technologies like React, PHP, SCSS, and Webpack. I also have
                knowledge in UI/UX and am becoming more interested in new web
                technologies, like NextJS and Vercel.
