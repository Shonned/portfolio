After announcing the return of Leitlearn in January 2025, I quickly realized that my personal time was limited.  

However, I didn’t want to abandon the Leitlearn project, which I had already invested so much energy into. 

That’s why I decided to release a **Leitlearn Lite** version, offering the core features in a streamlined package.

## What’s Included in Leitlearn Lite

- **Authentication** with email or Google
- **Flashcard creation** with cover images via the Unsplash API
- **Flashcard editing**
- **Leitner revision system** for spaced repetition
- **Express mode** to allow immediate review sessions without waiting

*Example 2: Editing an existing deck*

## What’s Missing

Some features announced for the full version are not included in Lite:

- **Leitlearn AI**
- **Social features**
- **Gamification** (rewards, streaks)
- **Notifications system**

## Free and Accessible

Even though this version is less complete, it is **completely free**—there are no payment systems.

A user account is required to save decks and learning sessions.

## UI Design Showcase

I didn’t want to waste all the work I put into the design, which I consider my best so far.  

So, here’s a look at some of the custom UI components I built, even if they’re not all available in the online version:
